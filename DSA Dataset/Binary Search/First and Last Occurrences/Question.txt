First and Last Occurrences
Given a sorted array arr with possibly some duplicates, the task is to find the first and last occurrences of an element x in the given array.
Note: If the number x is not found in the array then return both the indices as -1.

Examples:
Input: arr[] = [1, 3, 5, 5, 5, 5, 67, 123, 125], x = 5
Output: [2, 5]
Explanation: First occurrence of 5 is at index 2 and last occurrence of 5 is at index 5
Input: arr[] = [1, 3, 5, 5, 5, 5, 7, 123, 125], x = 7
Output: [6, 6]
Explanation: First and last occurrence of 7 is at index 6

Input: arr[] = [1, 2, 3], x = 4
Output: [-1, -1]
Explanation: No occurrence of 4 in the array, so, output is [-1, -1]
Constraints:
1 ≤ arr.size() ≤ 106
1 ≤ arr[i], x ≤ 109
