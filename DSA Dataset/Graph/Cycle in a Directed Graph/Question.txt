Given a Directed Graph with V vertices (Numbered from 0 to V-1) and E edges, check whether it contains any cycle or not.
The graph is represented as an adjacency list, where adj[i] contains a list of vertices that are directly reachable from vertex i. Specifically, adj[i][j] represents an edge from vertex i to vertex j.
Example 1:
Input:

 

Output: 1
Explanation: 3 -> 3 is a cycle
Example 2:
Input:
 

Output: 0
Explanation: no cycle in the graph
Constraints:
1 ≤ V, E ≤ 105
