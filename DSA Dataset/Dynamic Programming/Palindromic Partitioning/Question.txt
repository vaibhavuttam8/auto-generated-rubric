Palindromic Partitioning
Given a string s, a partitioning of the string is a palindrome partitioning if every sub-string of the partition is a palindrome. Determine the fewest cuts needed for palindrome partitioning of the given string.
Examples:
Input: s = "ababbbabbababa"
Output: 3
Explaination: After 3 partitioning substrings 
are "a", "babbbab", "b", "ababa".
Input: s = "aaabba"
Output: 1
Explaination: The substrings after 1
partitioning are "aa" and "abba".

Input: s = "aaa"
Output: 0
Explaination: No partitioning is required.
Constraints:
1 ≤ |s| ≤ 103
s contain lowercase letters only
