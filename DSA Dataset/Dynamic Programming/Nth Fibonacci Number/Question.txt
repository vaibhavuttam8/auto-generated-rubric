Nth Fibonacci Number
Given a non-negative integer n, your task is to find the nth Fibonacci number.
The Fibonacci sequence is a sequence where the next term is the sum of the previous two terms. The first two terms of the Fibonacci sequence are 0 followed by 1. The Fibonacci sequence: 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21
The Fibonacci sequence is defined as follows:
•	F(0) = 0
•	F(1) = 1
•	F(n) = F(n - 1) + F(n - 2) for n > 1
Examples :
Input: n = 5
Output: 5
Explanation: The 5th Fibonacci number is 5.
Input: n = 0
Output: 0 
Explanation: The 0th Fibonacci number is 0.
Input: n = 1
Output: 1
Explanation: The 1st Fibonacci number is 1.
Constraints:
0 ≤ n ≤ 30
